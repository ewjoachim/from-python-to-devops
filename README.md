# From Python to DevOps

In this repo, we try to gather short tutorials and follow up resources on many important subjects for software and python proficient people to learn web development, and deployment.

## Disclaimers, assumptions, constraints

Here are explicit constraints and assumptions that will guide our writing:

- Should fit withing 2 weeks full-time (6h a day, 5 days a week), so this means up to 60h of work. EDIT: haha lol. Nope. Not possible, too dense. Either drop half of the curriculum, or accept it takes more.
- The assumption is that the target learner prefers to get a basic understanding and theory first, then do exercices. Every learner is different, though. We work from the ground up, building knowledge from the bases, trying to limit the "leap of faith" avoiding things like "do this thing you don't understand, and it works magically". This means we need to cover a lot of material before we get to the most useful knowledge, but hopefully, it will make those things more understandable.
- The learner already confortable around Python, shell, and development in general (git, ...). For example, they're Data Scientist, it's just that they never did web development in particular. In fact, we'll assume they're Machine Learning specialist, trying to expose their work through a web interface.
- This curriculum is being prepared for a specific learner in mind. We may skip important things that we trust they already know, and make different adaptations. That being said, there's no reason this would not benefit other individuals in a similar situation.
- The aim is not to become "proficient" in everything but to demistify it and provide resources for further learning. Also, we're heading towards a "backend devops" idea, with a sprinkle of front end. Not full stack.
